/*How to create/update database schema*/

Make sure first there is a database named 'butil' in mysql

1. Open app/config/database.php and input mysql username/password or anything else necessary (The file is gitignored so that other's config wont be affected)

2. In github, open web-butil, then click gear icon(upper-right)->'Open in gitshell'

3. Type in 'php artisan migrate'

4. Repeat 2 and 3 if the schema is updated

*Type 'php artisan migrate:rollback' to return schema to previous version (in case lng)

*Type 'php artisan db:seed' to populate db with pre-made dummy data
